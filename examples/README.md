# Example Programs

Here you will find example programs that are written in [_Loop_](https://looplang.org). 
They illustrate the capability of Loop, but also as a reference for conventions, help for developing 
in **and** for Loop.

All the example programs will be maintained thus, they will always be up to date with the
latest version of Loop. 

## Contributing

There are a couple of requirements for new example programs, they are given below:
 - Programs need to be as compact as possible. Try to make it less than 100 lines.
 - Try to focus programs on a single feature. Do not mix web and multi-threading for example. 
   Those are two separate concepts/features, and thus need to be different examples.
 - A program needs to be different to other example programs. We do not want 10 different sorting
   algorithms as examples.

When you have finished an example, you can create a merge request on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/looplanguage/loop). 
The name of the branch needs to be like this: `LOOP-122-[EXAMPLE FILE NAME]`. GitLab does not allow to merge 
it into main, if you do not name your branch like this; Due to the
[Jira](https://looplang.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/LOOP/issues) integration.
