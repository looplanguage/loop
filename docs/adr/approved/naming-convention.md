# Naming Conventions

* Status: solved 
* Deciders: Kane Petra, Wouter Pennings
* Date: 27-06-2022
* Loop version: 0.2.0

Technical Story: https://looplang.atlassian.net/browse/LOOP-201

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, when naming variables, functions or defining types is done based on what the programmer thinks is best.

## Decision Drivers

* Programmers have different opinions and it hurts coding style
* Consistent style means less errors

## Considered Options

* Follow Rust's style guide
* Design our own style guide
* Follow other languages style guide

## Decision Outcome

We decided to go with option 1: Follow Rust's style guide.

This was done to not need to spent too much time designing our own or to research style guides from other languages.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Style guide instantly available
* No need to spend time on designing a style guide

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We can not design our own style guide
