# Architectural Decision Records

> "*An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.*" ~ [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/)

In Loop more things fall under this category, mainly language features itself. Constants or type checking are examples of where a architectural design document was used. The main purpose of the ADR is to have a history of all the design descisions that are made (Hence the name "records"). When one wants to know why a certain choice was made they can go back in the archive and see the motivation, contributors, etc.

## How to use

If you want to propose a change to Loop, use the template *[adr-template.md](adr-template.md) (regardless if it is a feature, architecture decision, etc.) There are a couple of fields that must be filled, these contain essential information to keep the records understandable in the future:
* Status: **Approved | Pending | Rejected**
* Deciders: **The names of everyone involved**
* Date: **The date of the latest edit**
* Loop version: **Version of Loop is applies to**

If you want a reference version, than take a look at [this](approved/recursive-return-type-checking.md) document.
