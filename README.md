> **Note:** Loop is still in its early days of development, and thus is not production-ready.

## Development Roadmap

Loop 0.2.0 will be released at the beginning of summer 2022. The main goal is to make sure that everything you want
can be written in Loop; These are the developments we will be working on:

 - [ ] Foreign Function Interface to call Rust functions in Loop.
 - [ ] Finalizing compilation to DLang.
 - [ ] Expanding native language features: structs, http, etc.
 - [ ] Beginning of standard library
 - [ ] Significantly improving documentation

## Get started (usage)

1. Download a pre-built binary from [downloads.looplang.org](https://downloads.looplang.org)
2. Run `./loop` to start the REPL environment or
3. Run `./loop FILENAME.lp` to run a specific file.

## Get Started (development)

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed
2. You also need a DLang compiler, get one that works on your platform: https://dlang.org/download.html
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://gitlab.com/looplanguage/loop`
4. Enter the repository `cd loop`
5. Run the command `cargo run`
6. The Loop shell should now popup

Go to our [Jira](https://looplang.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/LOOP/issues) board to see all the issues and tasks to work on.

### Compiler Walkthrough

> **Note:** We are currently working on a technical document that is way more detailed and comprehensive than the one below.

Parsing is the first thing that happens when a Loop program 
is ran. The Lexer converts the input program to tokens and 
the parser parses that to an abstract syntax tree (AST). The 
compiler runs through the AST and generates [DLang](https://github.com/dlang) code, a DLang compiler will compile that to a executable.

### Folder structure

The Loop compiler is fully contained in the `/src` folder

```
